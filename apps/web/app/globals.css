⚠️ Important: Tailwind v4 Zero-Config Import Order in a Monorepo Setup

Avoid importing `@import "tailwindcss"` in both the shared config and the app-level CSS.
This will lead to override issues and broken utility detection.

✅ Correct Import Order (in app-level global.css):
1. @repo/tailwind-config → contains :root, custom animations, etc. (no Tailwind import inside)
2. @repo/ui/styles.css → shared UI component styles (also without Tailwind import)
3. tailwindcss → must come last to ensure all tokens, base layers, and variables are registered

⚠️ If `@import "tailwindcss"` comes first (e.g., inside the shared config), then:
- Custom CSS variables, base styles, and layers may not be recognized
- Breakpoints, colors, and utilities may silently fail

🔁 Rule of thumb: Only import "tailwindcss" **once** at the app level — not inside shared config.
